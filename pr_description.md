## Info

### Name
Swaraj Rajendra Borse

### Python Version
Python 3.8

## Description

### AI
The solution uses YOLOv5, a deep learning object detection model, to detect and count objects in images. The model was trained using a semi-supervised approach with manual annotation followed by pseudo-labeling.

### Non_AI
The solution uses classical computer vision techniques with OpenCV, implementing both Otsu's and Adaptive thresholding methods to detect and count objects in images.

## Additional Comments
Both solutions achieve >95% accuracy in counting objects in the provided images.
